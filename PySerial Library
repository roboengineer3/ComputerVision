PySerial - Communication with Arduino & Hardware
ðŸ”¹ What is it?
PySerial allows Python to communicate with microcontrollers (Arduino, ESP32) via USB/serial port.

ðŸ”¹ Uses:
âœ… Send & Receive Data to/from Arduino
âœ… Control Motors, LEDs, and Relays from Python
âœ… Read Sensor Values from Arduino into Python
âœ… Works with Raspberry Pi to control hardware

ðŸ”¹ Example Use Case:

You used PySerial in your AC appliance control project to send hand gesture commands to Arduino! ðŸ”¥
ðŸ”¹ Example Code to Send Command to Arduino:

import serial
import time

arduino = serial.Serial('COM5', 9600)  # Change 'COM5' to your Arduino port
time.sleep(2)  # Wait for connection

arduino.write(b'1')  # Send '1' to Arduino to turn on an LED
print("Command Sent: LED ON")

arduino.close()
